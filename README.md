# Inverted-Double-Pendulum
This project simulates a single inverted pendulum using Pymunk, a 2D physics engine for Python. The goal is to balance the pendulum by applying a force to its base within a given range, calculated by various control methods. The simulation was developed as part of a graduation project at METU (Middle East Technical University) and serves as a testbed for experimenting with NEAT, PID, and LQR controllers. Additionally, PID and LQR were implemented on a real physical system.

## TODOs
- Add friction to the simulation.
- Resolve boundary issues when using speed as the control action, ensuring the base remains within the simulation window.
- Make it double!!
